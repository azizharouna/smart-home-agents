# Project Development Memo

## Current Implementation Status
✅ Created project structure  
✅ Implemented core documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, USE_CASES.md)  
✅ Developed cleaning agent with state management  
✅ Established domain models and exceptions  
✅ Configured logging infrastructure  

## Next Planned Steps

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Configuration System**
   - Environment variable management
   - Settings validation
   - Secret management

2. **Testing Framework**
   - Unit tests for cleaning agent
   - Integration test scenarios
   - Performance benchmarks

3. **Agent Enhancements**
   - Route optimization algorithm
   - Battery management system
   - Error recovery mechanisms

### Future Roadmap
- Security agent implementation
- IoT sensor integration
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- CI/CD pipeline setup

## Key Decisions
- Using Pydantic for state validation
- Structured logging approach
- Environment-based configuration
- Modular architecture design
