# Smart Home Agent Use Cases

## Primary Use Case: Autonomous Home Maintenance
**Problem**: 15% energy wasted by cleaning robots with poor state awareness  
**Solution**: LangGraph agents that:
- Optimize cleaning routes (state-aware pathing)
- Self-dock when battery <20% (guardrails)
- Integrate with IoT sensors (extensible architecture)

## Key Benefits
- 15-20% energy savings
- Reduced maintenance costs
- Scalable architecture
